# Background

I am setting up a Shiny Server following the instructions [in this post](https://deanattali.com/2015/05/09/setup-rstudio-shiny-server-digital-ocean/#user-libraries) by Dean Attali. In Step 8.2, it is recommended to use a git repository to populate the Shiny Server with Shiny apps. The purpose of this page is to document the steps to to do this.

# Step 1

- Write a new app on RStudio and store it in your shiny-server git repository that pushes to the repository setup in Step 8.2

# Step 2: Push commits from desktop to remote repo on Github

On your desktio CLI, type

    git add .
    git commi -m "Your message"
    git push origin master
    
# Step 3: Log into your DigitalOcean droplet

Log in by using

    ssh root@123.456.1.1
    su - user

# Step 4: Pull to grab changes that were made

    git pull 

# Step 5: Open app in browser
